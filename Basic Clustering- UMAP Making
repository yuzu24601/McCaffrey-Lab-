##Making UMAPs of granuloma data
##I made a Seurat object called "data_merged_all", which is an amalgamation of data from 12 granulomas.Then, Harmony integration was used. 
# Run UMAP, find neighbors, and clusters after Harmony
data_merged_all <- data_merged_all %>%
  RunUMAP(reduction = "harmony", dims = 1:20) %>%
  FindNeighbors(reduction = "harmony", dims = 1:20) %>%
  FindClusters(resolution = 0.5) %>%
  identity()


# Plot UMAP, grouped by clusters
DimPlot(data_merged_all, reduction = "umap", group.by = "seurat_clusters", label = TRUE) +
  ggtitle("UMAP of clusters after Harmony integration")


##Making UMAPs of 4-6 week samples 
library(Seurat)
library(ggplot2)

# UMAP for 4-6 week samples
umap_4_6_weeks <- DimPlot(
  data_4_6_weeks,
  reduction = "umap",
  group.by = "seurat_clusters",
  label = TRUE,
  label.size = 4
) +
  ggtitle("UMAP of 4-6 Week Samples")

# UMAP for 9-12 week samples
umap_9_12_weeks <- DimPlot(
  data_9_12_weeks,
  reduction = "umap",
  group.by = "seurat_clusters",
  label = TRUE,
  label.size = 4
) +
  ggtitle("UMAP of 9-12 Week Samples")

# Display UMAPs
umap_4_6_weeks
umap_9_12_weeks
